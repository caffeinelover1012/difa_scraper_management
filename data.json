The concept of the FADN was launched in 1965, when Council Regulation 79/65 established the legal basis for the organisation of the network. It consists of an annual survey carried out by the Member States of the European Union. The services responsible in the Union for the operation of the FADN collect every year accountancy data from a sample of the agricultural holdings in the European Union. Derived from national surveys, the FADN is the only source of microeconomic data that is harmonised, i.e. the bookkeeping principles are the same in all countries. Holdings are selected to take part in the survey on the basis of sampling plans established at the level of each region in the Union. The survey does not cover all the agricultural holdings in the Union but only those which due to their size could be considered commercial.",

      "dataset_collection_method": "The basic approach of The DHS Program is to collect data that are comparable across countries. To achieve this, standard model questionnaires have been developed, along with a written description of why certain questions or sections have been included. These model questionnairesΓÇöwhich have been reviewed and modified in each of the seven phases of The DHS ProgramΓÇöform the basis for the questionnaires that are applied in each country. Typically, a country is asked to adopt the model questionnaire in its entirety, but can add questions of particular interest. However, questions in the model can be deleted if they are irrelevant in a particular country. There are two types of DHS surveys:                                Standard DHS Surveys have large sample sizes (usually between 5,000 and 30,000 households) and typically are conducted about every 5 years, to allow comparisons over time.                                Interim DHS Surveys focus on the collection of information on key performance monitoring indicators but may not include data for all impact evaluation measures (such as mortality rates). These surveys are conducted between rounds of DHS surveys and have shorter questionnaires than DHS surveys. Although nationally representative, these surveys generally have smaller samples than DHS surveys.                                 DHS surveys collect primary data using four types of Model Questionnaires. A Household Questionnaire is used to collect information on characteristics of the household's dwelling unit and characteristics of usual residents and visitors. It is also used to identify members of the household who are eligible for an individual interview. Eligible respondents are then interviewed using an Individual Woman's or Man's Questionnaire. The Biomarker Questionnaire is used to collect biomarker data on children, women, and men. For special information on topics that are not contained in the Model Questionnaires, optional Questionnaire Modules are available. Interviews are conducted only if the respondent provides voluntary informed consent. ",

This will mean collecting data on as many as 10.5 million farms (2016 data) in the EU.\n\nMember States will establish teams of supervisors and enumerators to conduct the Agricultural Census, typically overseen by a combination of civil servants from the Statistical Office and the Ministry of Agriculture. They will use all types of collection methods to complete the Agricultural Census, inter alia farm registers, administrative sources and surveys. For the surveys, enumerators will contact farmers over the internet, by telephone, by letter or through face-to-face questioning. By allowing a more extensive use of administrative sources in 2020, the overall cost of the census will be reduced. At the same time, the burden on farmers will be alleviated, as they will receive questionnaires that are already partially pre-filled.\n\nIn the EUΓÇÖs Agricultural Census 2020 approximately 300 variables will be collected, covering the following aspects on farming:\n\nGeneral characteristics of the farm and the farmer\nLand\nLivestock\nLabour force\nAnimal housing and manure management\nRural development support measures.",

For the 2020 survey cycle, EIA used Web and mail forms to collect detailed information on household energy characteristics. This information is combined with data from energy suppliers to these homes to estimate energy costs and usage for heating, cooling, appliances and other end uses ΓÇö information critical to meeting future energy demand and improving efficiency and building design.\n\nFirst conducted in 1978, the fifteenth RECS collected data from nearly 18,500 households in housing units statistically selected to represent the 123.5 million housing units that are occupied as a primary residence. Data from the 2020 RECS are tabulated by geography and for particularly characteristics, such as housing unit type and income, that are of particular interest to energy analysis.\n\nThe results of each RECS include data tables, a microdata file, and a series of reports. Data tables are generally organized across two headings; 'Household Characteristics' and 'Consumption & Expenditures.'",

PRISM datasets provide estimates of seven primary climate elements: precipitation (ppt), minimum temperature (tmin), maximum temperature (tmax), mean dew point (tdmean), minimum vapor pressure deficit (vpdmin), maximum vapor pressure deficit (vpdmax), and total global shortwave solar radiation on a horizontal surface (soltotal; available only as normals at this time). Mean temperature (tmean) is derived as the average of tmax and tmin. Three ancillary solar radiation variables are provided in the normals dataset: total global solar radiation on a horizontal surface under clear sky conditions (solclear), effective cloud transmittance (soltrans), and total global solar radiation on a sloped surface (solslope).",

Select USDA food codes representing foods or beverages that were reported 10 or more times in the WWEIA cycle, or are needed for the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) market basket update.\n    \n2. Review recipes in the FNDDS of the selected foods to determine whether recipe modifications are needed to accommodate convenience foods and include standard substitutions in the recipe.\n    \n3.

Link scanner data Universal Product Codes (UPCs) (barcodes) to food codes in the USDA nutrition databases using the PPC.\n    \n5. Convert purchase weight to edible weight for each UPC using the PPC conversion factors.\n    \n6. Sum the total expenditure and edible weight across UPCs for each USDA food code.\n    \n7. Calculate the average price per 100 grams of the USDA food codes by dividing expenditure by edible weight.\n    \n8. Apply average unit prices for the USDA food codes to the recipes identified in step two and calculate the unit price of the FNDDS foods selected in step one.\n    \n\nThe resulting prices are nationally representative of foods reported eaten by WWEIA/NHANES participants. The resulting price for any particular food may be derived from multiple brands and private labels, package sizes, flavors, and types. The IRI grocery scanner data represent individual products as purchased in a grocery store. The WWEIA/NHANES codes and supporting recipes in the FNDDS are more general (e.g., BBQ sauce versus a brand-specific BBQ sauce).",
