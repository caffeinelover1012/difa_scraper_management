This will mean collecting data on as many as 10.5 million farms (2016 data) in the EU.\n\nMember States will establish teams of supervisors and enumerators to conduct the Agricultural Census, typically overseen by a combination of civil servants from the Statistical Office and the Ministry of Agriculture. They will use all types of collection methods to complete the Agricultural Census, inter alia farm registers, administrative sources and surveys. For the surveys, enumerators will contact farmers over the internet, by telephone, by letter or through face-to-face questioning. By allowing a more extensive use of administrative sources in 2020, the overall cost of the census will be reduced. At the same time, the burden on farmers will be alleviated, as they will receive questionnaires that are already partially pre-filled.\n\nIn the EUâ€™s Agricultural Census 2020 approximately 300 variables will be collected, covering the following aspects on farming:\n\nGeneral characteristics of the farm and the farmer\nLand\nLivestock\nLabour force\nAnimal housing and manure management\nRural development support measures."
